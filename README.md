# Getting Started
This project was built using the following technologies:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

## Running
In order to run locally, you can simply run one of the two scripts in project root folder:

Bash: `./build-local.sh`

PowerShell: `./build-local.ps1`

## Deploying
As described here, [Getting Started with Next.js and Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-vercel), any change made to the main branch on GitHub will result a deploy on Vercel.

## Testing
I set some simple tests with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress). You can run using `npm run cypress:open`
